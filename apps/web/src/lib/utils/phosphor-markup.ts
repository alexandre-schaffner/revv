// ── Phosphor icons for imperative DOM callers ─────────────────────────────
//
// `@pierre/diff`'s header callbacks must return light-DOM `Element`s built by
// hand, so they can't render a `phosphor-svelte` component. Before this module
// those call sites hand-rolled their own 16-grid, 1.5px-stroke SVGs, which put
// a second icon geometry on screen next to the real phosphor set.
//
// This keeps one icon system by carrying phosphor's own 256-grid path data for
// the handful of glyphs an imperative caller needs. Paths are copied verbatim
// from `phosphor-svelte/lib/<Icon>.svelte`; the weight names match the
// component API, so a call site reads the same either way.
//
// Add a glyph here only when a component genuinely can't be used. Everything
// else imports from `phosphor-svelte/lib/*`.
